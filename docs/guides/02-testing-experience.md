# Chapter 2: Testing Experience

Now that you have a working IWSDK project, it's time to launch it and see it in action! This chapter covers how to run your development server and test your WebXR experience using both browser emulation and a physical VR headset.

## Getting Your Project Running

First, let's navigate to your project and get the development server started.

### Navigate to Your Project

Open your terminal and navigate to the project folder you created in Chapter 1:

```bash
cd my-iwsdk-app  # Replace with your actual project name
```

### Install Dependencies (If Needed)

If you chose "No" when asked to install dependencies during project creation, install them now:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary packages. If you already installed dependencies during project creation, you can skip this step.

### Launch the Development Server

Start your development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see output similar to:

```
  VITE v7.1.4  ready in 1234 ms

  ➜  Local:   https://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: https://192.168.1.100:5173/
  ➜  press h + enter to show help
```

Or, if you prefer a CLI summary after startup:

```bash
npx @iwsdk/cli dev status
```

::: warning HTTPS Required
Notice that the URL uses **HTTPS** (not HTTP). This is required for WebXR to work - browsers only allow WebXR on secure origins. IWSDK generates and caches an untrusted development certificate without installing a certificate authority or changing your operating-system trust store. The managed browser accepts it automatically; a physical headset shows its normal certificate warning, which you should accept to continue.
:::

Your development server is now running and ready for testing!

## Testing Your Project

Now that your development server is running, you can test your WebXR experience in two ways: with a physical headset for the full immersive experience, or on your desktop using IWER emulation.

### Option 1: Testing with a Physical Headset

If you have access to a VR headset, this provides the best testing experience for your WebXR application.

#### Recommended Headset

We recommend using a **[Meta Quest 3](https://www.meta.com/quest/quest-3/) or [Quest 3S](https://www.meta.com/quest/quest-3s/)** for development, as this tutorial is designed with these devices in mind. Other devices like the **Meta Quest 2** or **Pico 4** should also work well.

#### Testing on Meta Quest

The Meta Quest series has excellent WebXR support built into the headset's browser:

You can access the local development server from your XR headset using one of two methods: via your computer's IP address or by using ADB with port forwarding.

#### Method 1: Access via IP Address (Recommended)

On most home networks, you can access the local server directly. **Your headset must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network as your computer.**

1. **Put on your headset** and navigate to the browser app
2. **Find your computer's IP address** in the Vite dev server output (look for the "Network" URL)
   - Example output: `➜  Network: https://192.168.1.100:5173/`
   - `npx @iwsdk/cli dev status` also reports the current runtime URL
3. **Enter the development URL** in your headset's browser using the reported network host and port, for example `https://192.168.1.100:5173`
4. **Accept the certificate warning** (this is normal for local development with self-signed certificates)
5. **Click "Enter XR"** when the page loads

#### Method 2: Access via ADB Port Forwarding (Fallback)

If accessing via IP address doesn't work due to network restrictions or firewall settings (common on corporate networks), use ADB (Android Debug Bridge) with port forwarding:

1. **Connect your headset to your computer** via USB cable
2. **Enable developer mode** on your headset (check your device's documentation for instructions)
3. **Set up port forwarding**:
   - Open Chrome on your computer and navigate to `chrome://inspect/#devices`
   - Your headset should appear under "Remote Target"
   - Click "Port forwarding..." in Chrome DevTools
   - Add a rule to forward the port shown in the Local URL from your computer to your headset
4. **Access the local server** on your headset by entering the forwarded URL, for example `https://localhost:5173`
5. **Accept the certificate warning** and **click "Enter XR"** when the page loads

Here's what your WebXR experience looks like when running on a Meta Quest 3 device:

  <source src="/testing-experience/starter-vr.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

#### Previewing gaze on a headset without eye tracking

For development on a Quest headset without eye tracking, configure
`dev.targetDevicePreview`. The preview preserves the headset's native viewer,
hands, and controllers, and adds head-directed Meta VR Glasses test gaze only
when the app requests `gazeTracking`. This development-only behavior is omitted
from production builds; see
[Gaze and Pinch](/concepts/xr-input/gaze#test-on-a-headset-without-eye-tracking).

### Option 2: Testing with IWER (Browser Emulation)

IWER (Immersive Web Emulator Runtime) is a WebXR emulator that runs entirely in your browser, allowing you to develop and test WebXR applications without a headset. By default, it activates on localhost and skips the Quest browser, and it provides mouse/keyboard controls to simulate VR interactions.

Learn more about IWER at [meta-quest.github.io/immersive-web-emulation-runtime/](https://meta-quest.github.io/immersive-web-emulation-runtime/).

### How IWER Integration Works

IWER is injected by the `iwsdkDev` Vite plugin, but its project settings live in
`iwsdk.config.json`:

```json
{
  "dev": {
    "emulator": {
      "device": "metaQuest3"
    }
  }
}
```

Keep the plugin call in `vite.config.ts` bare so it reads the project manifest:

```typescript
iwsdkDev();
```

**Configuration options:**

- **`device`**: Which headset to emulate (`metaQuest2`, `metaQuest3`, `metaQuestPro`, `metaVRGlasses`, or `oculusQuest1`). `metaVRGlasses` emulates Meta VR Glasses' narrower field of view and adds gaze input. More headset presets and custom headset configuration support coming soon.
- **`activation`**: Controls when IWER activates. The default `'localhost'` is smart - it activates IWER when you access the site from localhost (typically your computer, which needs emulation), but not when accessing via IP address (typically from a headset with native WebXR support).
- **`userAgentException`**: Adds an extra layer of protection by skipping IWER activation if the browser's user agent matches a pattern (like `OculusBrowser`). This ensures IWER won't activate on headsets even when using ADB port forwarding with localhost.
- **`environment`**: Synthetic room data for AR scene-understanding testing, such as `living_room`

To test with IWER, open the Local URL reported by Vite or `npx @iwsdk/cli dev status` in your desktop browser and click "Enter XR". Here's what the emulated experience looks like:

  <source src="/testing-experience/starter-iwer.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.

### IWER Controls

After entering XR, use the IWER toolbar and controller panels overlaid on the
page:

1. Click the **Play mode** button (the circle-play icon) to lock the pointer.
   Move the mouse to look around. Press <kbd>Esc</kbd> to leave play mode.
2. Hold <kbd>Left Shift</kbd> while using <kbd>W</kbd>, <kbd>A</kbd>,
   <kbd>S</kbd>, and <kbd>D</kbd> to move the emulated headset through the
   scene. Use <kbd>Left Shift</kbd> +
   <kbd>ArrowUp</kbd>/<kbd>ArrowDown</kbd> to adjust height.
   These keys continue to drive their controller thumbsticks while Left Shift
   is held, so the default XR starter moves both the emulated headset and the
   player. If you need isolated headset free-flight, use the controller gear
   buttons to remap the thumbstick keys first.
3. Without <kbd>Left Shift</kbd>,
   <kbd>W</kbd>/<kbd>A</kbd>/<kbd>S</kbd>/<kbd>D</kbd> drive the left
   thumbstick. The arrow keys drive the right thumbstick.
4. In play mode, left mouse is the right-controller **trigger/select** and
   right mouse is the right-controller **grip/squeeze**. The starter plant's
   `DistanceGrabbable` uses trigger/select; near-field `OneHandGrabbable` and
   `TwoHandsGrabbable` interactions use grip/squeeze.
5. Outside play mode, click a controller's **Trig** or **Grip** value for a
   momentary press. Use the adjacent pin button to latch that value until you
   release it. Open the gear button to inspect or remap keyboard bindings.
6. To move the starter plant, leave play mode, latch **Trig**, and drag the
   controller's transform handle in the scene. Use **Grip** instead when testing
   a near-field grabbable. Click the handle to switch between translation and
   rotation, then release the latch to drop the object.
7. Use **Select input mode** in the toolbar to choose controllers or hands.
   Use **Reset device transforms** to return the headset and inputs to their
   default pose.

The default left-controller trigger and squeeze bindings are <kbd>Q</kbd> and
<kbd>E</kbd>. The visible binding chips in each controller panel are the source
of truth if you have remapped a control.

For gaze testing, set the emulator device to `metaVRGlasses` and choose
**Gaze + Hands** from the input menu; this selects hand
input and **Cursor** gaze together. Cursor gaze disables Play mode: aim with
the pointer and right-drag to look around. A pinch from the selected commit
hand selects or grabs. **Head** is an explicit head-directed diagnostic mode.
**Off** disconnects the gaze source so you can verify that the application
restores ordinary hand rays. See [Gaze and Pinch](/concepts/xr-input/gaze) for
the full interaction and fallback model.

For automated interaction, use the CLI sequence in
[AI workflows: XR Interaction](/ai/workflows#xr-interaction).

## What's Next

Excellent! You now have a running WebXR application and understand how to test it both in the browser with IWER emulation and on a physical headset.

In Chapter 3, we'll dive into creating and manipulating 3D objects using Three.js fundamentals within the IWSDK framework.
