# Minimal Scene Walkthrough

This walkthrough adds one visible Three.js object to the generated IWSDK
starter while preserving the starter's existing robot and welcome-panel
systems. It shows the complete `src/index.ts` or `src/index.js` file so you can
see exactly where application code belongs. The same source works in both the
TypeScript and JavaScript starters.

## Replace `src/index.ts` or `src/index.js`

```js
import { BoxGeometry, Mesh, MeshBasicMaterial, World } from '@iwsdk/core';
import projectOptions from 'virtual:iwsdk-project';
import { PanelSystem } from './panel.js';
import { RobotSystem } from './robot.js';

const sceneContainer = document.getElementById('scene-container');
if (!(sceneContainer instanceof HTMLDivElement)) {
  throw new Error('Missing #scene-container');
}

// Create the IWSDK world from iwsdk.config.json and its active scene.
World.create(sceneContainer, projectOptions).then((world) => {
  // Three.js supplies the geometry, material, mesh, and transforms.
  const cube = new Mesh(
    new BoxGeometry(0.5, 0.5, 0.5),
    new MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x4f8cff }),
  );

  // X is left/right, Y is down/up, and negative Z is forward from the
  // starter origin. This places the cube below the welcome panel, two metres
  // away, so both remain visible when you enter XR.
  cube.position.set(0, 0.75, -2);

  // Register the Three.js object with IWSDK's ECS and level lifecycle.
  world.createTransformEntity(cube);

  // Systems contain behavior that runs every frame or reacts to ECS queries.
  world.registerSystem(RobotSystem);
  world.registerSystem(PanelSystem);
});
```

Run the project:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The blue cube should appear in front of the starting position. The starter
robot and welcome panel are examples rather than required framework objects;
you can remove them when you replace their scene nodes and system registrations
with your own content.

## Where Different Work Belongs

- `iwsdk.config.json` selects the scene, assets, components, XR mode, and
  optional runtime features.
- `public/scenes/*.iwsdk.scene.json` holds declarative scene composition.
- `src/index.ts` creates the world, adds procedural objects, and registers
  systems.
- `src/*.ts` system files contain application behavior.

entities.
