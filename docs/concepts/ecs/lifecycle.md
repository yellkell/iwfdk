# Lifecycle

Mental model: lifecycle is about when the ECS does what. Understand boot, system setup, per‑frame execution, and teardown.

## World lifecycle and boot sequence

When you call `World.create(container, options)` IWSDK:

1. Constructs a `World` instance and registers core components/systems: `Transform`, `Visibility`, `TransformSystem`, `VisibilitySystem`.
2. Creates Three.js objects: `Scene`, `PerspectiveCamera`, `WebGLRenderer`; enables WebXR.
3. Wraps the Scene in an entity (`world.sceneEntity`) and initializes an `activeLevel` entity beneath it.
4. Loads the authored level environment. Dome, IBL, and light components are
   explicit scene data; IWSDK does not inject missing lighting.
5. Creates `XRInputManager`; wires `player` (XROrigin) and `input` into the world.
6. Registers core feature systems (always‑on UI, Audio; optional Locomotion/Grabbing) with explicit priorities.
7. Initializes `AssetManager`.
8. Starts the render loop (`renderer.setAnimationLoop`): each tick sets
   `visibilityState`, runs `world.update(delta, time)`, invokes registered
   `world.onXRFrame` callbacks when an XR frame exists, then renders.
9. If `options.xr.offer` is 'once' or 'always', IWSDK offers an XR session after init (and re‑offers on end if 'always'). Otherwise, call `world.launchXR()` manually when the user presses your XR button.
10. Preloads assets (if provided) and requests an initial level load via `world.loadLevel(url?)`. Later scene swaps can use either `world.loadLevel(url)` or `world.loadSceneDocument(document)`.

Implications

- Systems run on every animation frame in priority order before the scene is rendered.
- Default priorities (negative numbers run earlier): Locomotion (−5), Input (−4), Grabbing (−3). You can pass `{ priority: number }` when registering a system.
- `visibilityState` is updated each frame from the XR session (or `non-immersive`).

## Choosing a per-frame API

Use a System's `update(delta, time)` for ordinary animation and application
logic. Systems run in browser and immersive modes, participate in priority
ordering, and keep behavior inside the ECS lifecycle.

Use `world.onXRFrame((frame, delta, time) => { ... })` only when code needs the
live `XRFrame`, such as raw hit-test results, depth information, or viewer poses.
These callbacks run only while an immersive XR frame exists, after systems and
before rendering. Call the returned unsubscribe function during cleanup.

Do not create a second `requestAnimationFrame` or `renderer.setAnimationLoop`
for application behavior; IWSDK's existing render loop drives both APIs.

## System lifecycle (per class)

- `init()`
  - Subscribe to query `qualify`/`disqualify` events.
  - Set up configs (`this.config.foo.subscribe(...)`).
  - Wire DOM/renderer listeners; enqueue cleanups into `this.cleanupFuncs` if you create disposables.

- `update(delta, time)`
  - Iterate your query sets. Use `for (const e of this.queries.name.entities)`.
  - Use `.peek()` when reading config signals inside tight loops to avoid unnecessary reactivity.
  - Avoid allocations and nested loops in hot paths.

- `destroy()`
  - Dispose resources and undo listeners. IWSDK calls all `cleanupFuncs` for you.

## Query membership and when it changes

- Adding/removing a component on an entity (`addComponent` / `removeComponent`) triggers query re‑evaluation for component presence.
- Changing a component value with `setValue` triggers re‑evaluation for queries whose `where:` predicates depend on that component.
- `getVectorView` returns a typed slice; mutating it does NOT trigger re‑evaluation on its own. If a query depends on that field, write back via `setValue` or mirror a scalar used in predicates.
- Subscribe to membership edges:

```ts
this.queries.panels.subscribe('qualify', (e) => {
  /* attach once */
});
this.queries.panels.subscribe('disqualify', (e) => {
  /* cleanup */
});
```

## Entity lifecycle

- `createEntity()` creates a bare entity (no `object3D`).
- `createTransformEntity(object?, parentOrOptions?)` creates an entity with an `object3D`, injects a `Transform`, and parents it under the level root or scene based on options.
- `entity.destroy()` marks the entity inactive, clears its bitmask, resets query membership, and detaches its `object3D` from the scene. GPU resources (geometry, materials, textures) are preserved.
- `entity.dispose()` does everything `destroy()` does, plus disposes all GPU resources. Use with caution when resources may be shared.

::: tip
Use `destroy()` by default. Only use `dispose()` when you're certain the entity's resources aren't shared with other entities.
:::

Parenting rules

- If you pass `{ parent: Entity }`, the resulting `object3D` is added under the parent’s `object3D`.
- `{ persistent: true }` forces parenting under the scene (survives level swaps).
- Otherwise, entities created during a level load are parented under the active level root; persistent utilities under the scene.

## Frame order recap

```text
set visibilityState → world.update(delta,time) → onXRFrame callbacks → render
```

Within `world.update`, systems run in ascending priority (more negative first). Use lower (more negative) priorities for input/physics that must run before visuals.

### Frame diagram (text)

```text
requestAnimationFrame / XRAnimationFrame
  └─ compute delta,time
     ├─ world.visibilityState ← session.visibilityState
     ├─ world.update(delta,time)
     │   ├─ systems @ priority … -5, -4, -3, 0, 1 …
     │   └─ queries keep sets up to date (qualify/disqualify emitted)
     ├─ world.onXRFrame callbacks (active XR sessions only)
     └─ renderer.render(scene,camera)
```
