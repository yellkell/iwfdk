# IWSDK App

This project uses `iwsdk.config.json` for declarative scene, asset, component,
XR, and emulator configuration. Application systems remain explicit in
`src/index.ts`.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Use the Runtime and Editor controls in the managed browser to switch between
the running experience and its authored scene.

## Starter content

The robot and welcome panel are small examples of authored scene content plus
runtime systems. The robot turns toward the player's head and plays a sound
when pressed. To remove the robot, delete its scene node, its `RobotSystem`
registration from `src/index.ts` or `src/index.js`, and its `Robot` registration
from `src/components.ts` or `src/components.js`; you can then delete the unused
robot component and system files. To remove the welcome panel, delete its scene
node and its `PanelSystem` registration from the application entry point.
