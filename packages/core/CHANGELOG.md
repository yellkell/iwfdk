# @iwsdk/core

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- @iwsdk/locomotor@1.0.1
- @iwsdk/scene-composition@1.0.1
- @iwsdk/xr-input@1.0.1

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- a79f1ff: Release IWSDK 1.0, the first stable release of the Immersive Web SDK runtime
  and tooling packages. The SDK packages continue to share one fixed version, and
  breaking API changes now require a new major version.

### Minor Changes

- 15688e2: Add configurable gaze input, gaze-driven pointer selection, native-session
  `gaze-tracking` and `eye-tracking` feature requests, a `metaVRGlasses` desktop
  emulator device with gaze input, and a development-only Meta VR Glasses gaze
  preview for physical Quest headsets.
- d0b24a1: Add bounded live UIKitML element inspection to the CLI and MCP runtime, including
  current ID, class, text, layout, interaction, property, and effective visibility
  state. Teach generated UI-agent guidance to use the inspection command for
  runtime verification.
- 13a5cbe: Add opt-in native Quest WebXR control sessions, session-grant launch support,
  deterministic physical-browser routing, and generated-project guidance for
  running IWSDK tests through an ADB-reversed localhost connection.
- 438f10c: Existing `physics: true` projects now run Havok in a Web Worker at a fixed 60
  Hz by default, using transferable ArrayBuffer exchanges and render
  interpolation. Add a shared main-thread mode for debugging and compatibility,
  plus debugger pause/step synchronization across both execution modes.
- e18c42a: Harden the CLI-managed development runtime with one fail-closed workspace
  owner, an explicit managed-browser lifecycle, exact managed and physical target
  routing, bounded command execution, and runtime status/recovery tools. Dev
  startup uses Vite's resolved application port and may return before the browser
  command path is ready; inspect `browserCommandReady` or use `runtime wait` before
  issuing browser-backed commands. A configured `server.port` is the runtime's
  address, so an occupied port now fails startup instead of moving to the next
  free port; an explicit `server.strictPort` still wins. Recovery reports `browser_relaunched` without
  replaying the command, while failures after dispatch report `outcome_unknown`.

  Managed Chromium uses a private profile in OS temporary storage that survives
  automatic browser recovery while retained. Stop active dev processes before
  upgrading the CLI and Vite plugin together. Native pose overrides are enabled
  only for explicitly configured Quest sessions; other browsers continue using
  IWER emulation.

### Patch Changes

- ed2a6b1: Normalize non-indexed and mixed-index locomotion environment meshes before
  building collision geometry, report unusable environments clearly, and
  document that grab components are mutually exclusive per entity.
- aee9970: Stop camera tracks when sources are restarted, removed, hidden, or destroyed, and require explicit retry after camera errors.
- ce9cdad: Embed TypeScript sources in the published source maps for the runtime packages,
  and pre-bundle the elics dependency of `@iwsdk/core` in development. The Vite
  development server no longer warns that source maps point to missing source
  files, and browser devtools can show SDK source when stepping into it.
- 4d4efa0: Apply one-shot physics impulses independently of render cadence and preserve
  vertical offsets for `PivotY` followers.
- 52c7378: Pin standalone core installs to the supported super-three runtime instead of resolving an untested latest Three.js release.

  Existing applications must use `"three": "npm:super-three@0.181.0"` and the
  matching npm or pnpm override so IWSDK and application code share one Three.js
  module instance.

- 3306963: Ignore invisible objects and descendants of invisible objects during pointer hit testing.
- 2c7b66c: Clamp distance-grab interpolation after stalled frames so position and rotation
  cannot extrapolate into invalid transforms.

  Wake locomotion after environment changes, teleports, and successful jumps,
  allow the first jump immediately, and restart the idle timeout on static-ground
  landings so the float spring settles before sleep.

  Keep native XR composition layers aligned with player space, preserve their
  configured full dimensions and scale, synchronize visibility and geometry, fall
  back safely for unsupported transforms, and release resources during teardown.

  Clear session-owned depth uniforms during XR exit, component removal, and system
  teardown, and require fresh per-session depth data before re-enabling occlusion.

  Refresh retained plane and mesh geometry when WebXR reports updates, compute
  correct axis-aligned mesh bounds, and skip BVH acceleration for compatible
  foreign Three.js geometries that do not expose the extension.

- 3306963: Preserve the original DistanceGrabbable transform across two-hand grab handoffs.
- 3306963: Forward canvas pointer events synchronously so Spatial UI actions retain browser user activation.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- c463f17: Load `.uikitml` source files directly at runtime with
  `@drawcall/uikitml@0.1.8` and UIKit 1.0.74. Panel UI now parses styles and TTF
  font declarations without generated JSON, and supports typed custom component
  sets through `features.spatialUI`.

  The `@iwsdk/vite-plugin-uikitml` package is removed. Starters and examples now
  ship their UIKitML sources from `public/ui` as ordinary static assets.

- 91047c5: Replace the Meta Spatial Editor integration path with the native IWSDK 3D scene
  editor and native scene JSON workflow.

  Meta Spatial Editor integration is deprecated from this release onward. New and
  migrated projects should use `public/scenes/*.iwsdk.scene.json`, the clean managed
  origin workspace, and direct file authoring with the compact `scene_*` observation
  tools. Code remains supported for procedural behavior, systems,
  animation, and advanced app logic.

  The replacement includes WebGL/IWSDK editor rendering, real scene asset loading,
  camera and orientation controls, transform gizmos, scene hierarchy editing,
  schema-driven component editing, agent screenshots from the editor viewport,
  migrated examples/starters, Meta Spatial removal audits, and automated app plus
  editor render-proof evidence. Authored transforms support zero scale and mirrored
  negative scale; world-preserving reparent operations retain reflections and report
  an operation-specific error only when a singular transform cannot be decomposed.

  The legacy `@iwsdk/glxf` package and fallback level importer are removed.
  `World.loadLevel()` now accepts native `.iwsdk.scene.json` and `.scene.json`
  documents only.

  Projects now declare their scene, asset/component modules, serializable world
  options, and emulator settings in `iwsdk.config.json`. Vite exposes those
  options through `virtual:iwsdk-project`; application code keeps ordinary
  `World.create()` and explicit system registration. Create embeds one common
  starter source instead of fetching Chef recipes, and the retired
  `@iwsdk/starter-assets` workspace package is removed.

  Native scene documents use one manifest-backed `asset` content kind plus groups,
  lights, prefabs, deterministic patterns, components, and constraints. glTF assets,
  procedural Three.js geometry, PBR materials, and custom shaders live in a dedicated
  application asset manifest imported independently by the runtime and editor. The
  editor exposes one unified asset catalog with manifest-derived bounds while keeping
  geometry and material authoring in code.

  The editor and runtime share lowering and expose scene metadata for parity checks.
  Generated Claude and Codex projects include the `iwsdk-scene-composer` skill for
  text, image, and hybrid static scene composition through direct files and the native
  editor. Scene roots can recursively import standalone modules with deterministic
  namespaces, and the managed editor watches root and module changes while preserving
  the last valid render on invalid edits.

  Release artifact verification now records package and documentation hashes and
  rejects package-manager-specific nested `node_modules`. Core and XR input use
  Three.js's public `MathUtils` export so packed modules remain portable.
  The reference-enabled starter and example paths pin patched Sharp 0.35.3 while
  upstream Transformers retains its older dependency range, and the reference
  package now ships complete warmup and offline-hosting guidance.

## 0.4.2

### Minor Changes

- `GrabSystem` now exposes two public methods so apps no longer need to
  deep-import the private `Handle` class to interrogate or unwind a grab
  (T270858800):
  - `forceRelease(entity: Entity): void` — drop a held entity (game reset,
    weapon swap, death/respawn, etc.). No-op if the entity is not held.
  - `getHolderHand(entity: Entity): 'left' | 'right' | null` — identify
    which controller is holding `entity`. Returns `null` when not held;
    for two-handed grabs, reports `'left'` deterministically.

### Patch Changes

- Changelog-formatted bullets (one per user-facing change). Copy into your changeset
  summary / changeset `.md`. `@iwsdk/*` is a fixed group, so all packages bump to 0.4.2.
  - Fix cylinder physics collider configuration when calling the Havok API so cylinder colliders collide correctly.
  - Keep the Havok physics engine and its ~2 MB WASM out of bundles when `features.physics` is disabled; physics is now code-split so `physics: false` apps no longer download it on first load.
  - Break a value-level import cycle (`ecs/world` ↔ `init/world-initializer`) that could leave a component reference `undefined` at class-body evaluation and crash `QueryManager.registerQuery` with `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'bitmask')` in bundled apps.
  - Guard `PhysicsSystem` against an unregistered `Grabbed` component, avoiding unnecessary coupling with the grab system (and a crash) when physics is used without grab.
  - Skip XR input visual initialization when the controller/hand GLTF asset fails to load (e.g. offline or firewalled CDN); input is still tracked without a visual instead of throwing `TypeError: Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'frustumCulled')`.
  - Spawn the dev runtime with `shell: true` on Windows so the `npm`/`pnpm`/`yarn` `.cmd` shims resolve — fixes `iwsdk dev up` failing with "Failed to start the dev process". Also fixes silent hzdb telemetry on Windows.

- Updated dependencies
  - @iwsdk/glxf@0.4.2
  - @iwsdk/locomotor@0.4.2
  - @iwsdk/xr-input@0.4.2

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- `AssetManager.getGLTF(key)` and `GLTFAssetLoader.getGLTF(key)` now return a fresh clone of the cached GLTF by default, preventing silent re-parenting when spawning multiple entities from the same asset. Pass `{ shared: true }` to opt back into the previous shared-instance behavior.
- Restore `world.camera` to its pre-XR local transform and projection after XR session exit, avoiding a broken browser fallback view after leaving immersive mode. Opt out with `xr: { restoreCameraOnExit: false }`.
- Route canvas pointer events correctly to screen-space `PanelUI`, including descendant hit handling.
- Add regression tests for GLTF cloning, browser camera restore, canvas pointer routing, and screen-space UI descendants.

- Updated dependencies
  - @iwsdk/glxf@0.4.1
  - @iwsdk/locomotor@0.4.1
  - @iwsdk/xr-input@0.4.1

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- Browser-first runtime, action-backed locomotion, ECS-native player rig,
  reference/RAG tooling, runtime-first MCP, quad/cylinder layers, and
  cloud-friendly headless browser.

  ### Browser-First Runtime

  First-class non-XR support: `World.create({ xr: false })` keeps a
  persistent `world.player` origin with `world.camera` parented under it,
  so the same scene runs in a desktop browser and on-device.
  - New `world.input` facade with `input.xr`, stateful keyboard,
    browser gamepad, and deprecated XR compatibility aliases.
  - `input.canvasPointerEvents` config + `CanvasPointerSystem` lifts
    canvas DOM pointer forwarding out of spatial UI into a first-class
    input source.
  - `CameraSystem` now runs while the world is visible (browser
    non-immersive included), only stopping on hidden page/session.
  - `examples/browser-first/`: `xr: false` scene with WASD locomotion,
    RMB-hold pointer-lock mouselook (gimbaled yaw on player + pitch on
    camera), 1st/3rd-person toggle, ray + audio + grab + physics.

  ### Action-Backed Locomotion

  New `world.input.actions` (`InputActionManager`) and
  `ActionLocomotionInputProvider` so locomotion reads intent
  (`locomotion.move`, `.jump`, `.turn`, `.teleport`) instead of polling
  raw devices.
  - Slide, Turn, and Teleport refactored onto the shared provider; XR
    thumbsticks and opt-in browser bindings (WASD, arrow keys, Space,
    standard gamepad) feed the same code paths.
  - New `features.locomotion.browserControls` for first-person browser
    apps.
  - Slide vignette parents to `world.camera` so it tracks the active
    viewport in both XR and browser modes.

  ### ECS-Native Player Rig

  XROrigin and its 7 child spaces (head, raySpaces, gripSpaces,
  indexTipSpaces) are now persistent ECS entities, so apps can parent
  entities under the player rig.
  - New `world.playerEntity`, `world.playerHeadEntity`, and
    `world.playerSpaceEntities` accessors, mirrored on `System`.

  ### Reference & RAG Tooling
  - New `@iwsdk/reference` workspace package with warmup/cache flow and
    a dedicated CLI/MCP parity harness.
  - New `@iwsdk/reference-assets` producer-side ingestion pipeline for
    reference corpus generation, model archive packaging, and versioned
    payload metadata.
  - Reference search wired into the CLI/runtime surface with adapter
    and browser error-handling guardrails.

  ### Runtime-First MCP / CLI Consolidation

  Session resolution, MCP stdio, and adapter management moved into
  `@iwsdk/cli` so generated apps and examples share one entrypoint.
  - MCP adapter configs (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Copilot) are
    written at project creation by `create-iwsdk` — or on demand via
    `iwsdk adapter sync` — instead of by `dev up` at runtime.
  - `ai.tools` removed from the vite plugin config and dev-up auto-sync
    flow; configs are now a project-level concern.
  - New `iwsdk adapter sync` is the single adapter-write entry point.

  ### Quad & Cylinder Layers

  WebXR composition layers support for quad and cylinder layers, with
  `examples/layers/` demonstrating correct depth occlusion against a
  spinning ball.

  ### Cloud-Friendly Headless Browser

  `@iwsdk/vite-plugin-dev` auto-detects GPUs and falls back to
  SwiftShader (Playwright Chromium's bundled software renderer) on
  GPU-less Linux cloud VMs.
  - Linux `/dev/dri` probe via `hasGpuDevice()`.
  - `IWSDK_GPU=auto|gpu|swiftshader` env override.
  - Selected backend logged on every launch.
  - Auto-installs Chromium and simplifies MCP config lifecycle.

  ### Scaffolding
  - `--canary [url]` replaces `--from <url>`; bare `--canary` uses a
    baked-in CloudFront CDN URL, custom URLs still accepted.
  - `--xr / --no-xr` for browser-only projects.
  - MSE AI Scene Creation knowledge bundled into the project template
    so AI agents can discover/install/launch Meta Spatial Editor and
    drive `mse-agent`.
  - iwer bumped 2.2.0 → 2.2.1 (RemoteControlInterface duration-action
    error handling and upfront device validation in
    `executeSelectSequence`).

  ### Bug Fixes
  - XR pointers, rays, and cursors now hide until controllers connect,
    fixing the origin-flash on session entry. New
    `XRInputManager.disablePointers()` is invoked on no-session,
    no-frame/reference-space, and session-ended paths.
  - Depth occlusion: `isGPUDepth` is now derived from
    `session.depthUsage === 'gpu-optimized'` so the preprocessing and
    material shaders agree, and MinMax-occluded entities persist across
    XR session re-entry.
  - `InputSystem` no longer drops all descendants on the first frame
    (the `dirty`-bit + `isDescendantOf` filter raced with
    `TransformSystem` parenting); descendant arrays now rebuild every
    frame.
  - UI scroll containers: `localClippingEnabled` set so images no
    longer overflow.
  - `vite-plugin-dev`: avoid pointer ID collision between the
    injection bundle and the host app.
  - `Grabbed` component added and used for physics kinematic override.
