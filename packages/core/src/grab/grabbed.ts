 * Transient state tag indicating an entity is currently being grabbed.

 * @remarks
 * - Managed by {@link GrabSystem}; do not add/remove this component manually.
 * - Added when a grab handle captures one or more pointers.
 * - Removed when all pointers are released and the grab ends.
 * - Often used to gate grab-state-specific logic (e.g. physics kinematic override).
 * - Works with {@link OneHandGrabbable}, {@link TwoHandsGrabbable}, and {@link DistanceGrabbable} entities.
