 * - Static bodies are used for immovable objects like walls and floors.

 * - Kinematic bodies can be moved programmatically but don't respond to physics forces.
 * - Internal properties like `_engineBody` are managed automatically by {@link PhysicsSystem}.

 * ```ts
 * entity.addComponent(PhysicsBody, {
