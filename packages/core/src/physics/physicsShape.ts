 * - Material properties (density, restitution, friction) affect physics behavior.
 * - Higher density increases mass, affecting how the object responds to forces.
 *
 * @example Auto‑detect shape from geometry
 * ```ts
 * entity.addComponent(PhysicsShape, {
 *   shape: PhysicsShapeType.Auto
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * @example Create a bouncy sphere
 * ```ts
 * entity.addComponent(PhysicsShape, {
 *   shape: PhysicsShapeType.Sphere,
 *   dimensions: [0.5, 0, 0], // radius = 0.5
 *   restitution: 0.8, // bouncy
 *   friction: 0.1 // low friction
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * @example Create a heavy box
 * ```ts
 * entity.addComponent(PhysicsShape, {
 *   shape: PhysicsShapeType.Box,
 *   dimensions: [2, 1, 1], // 2x1x1 meters
 *   density: 5.0, // high density
