# `@iwsdk/cli`

Runtime-first CLI for Immersive Web SDK starter apps.

This package is the public `iwsdk` executable used by starters and AI tooling.
It owns:

- dev server lifecycle commands
- adapter sync and status
- reference status and recovery warmup commands (fresh installed scaffolds warm
  the shared cache automatically)
- runtime-resolved MCP stdio access
- direct runtime control commands

## Running without a local install

Starter apps install this package and should run `npx @iwsdk/cli ...` from the app
directory. Elsewhere, use the scoped package explicitly so npm does not resolve
the unrelated `iwsdk` placeholder package:

```bash
npm exec --package @iwsdk/cli -- iwsdk --help
```

## Coding-agent adapters

`iwsdk adapter sync` preserves unrelated settings while configuring the native
repository surfaces for Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Codex, and
OpenCode. Use `--tools claude,codex` to limit the selection.

Generated starters give Claude Code its native `CLAUDE.md`, scoped rules, and
skill tree. Codex, Cursor, Copilot, and OpenCode share byte-identical Agent
Skills under `.agents/skills`; Cursor and Copilot receive native scoped rules,
while Codex and OpenCode receive nested `AGENTS.md` files. Where a harness
supports repository-scoped permissions, sync preapproves only IWSDK-managed MCP
namespaces and skill loading. Copilot tool approval remains an explicit VS Code
action because it has no supported repository config for that choice.

- `iwsdk adapter status` reports MCP, instruction, and permission state.
- `iwsdk adapter prune` removes managed MCP/permission entries and preserves
  editable instruction files.
- `iwsdk adapter prompt` prints exact setup instructions for another harness.

## Runtime ownership and targets

One canonical app workspace has one dev runtime and at most one managed browser.
This guarantee is within one OS/process namespace. Stop running dev processes
before upgrading the CLI and plugin together; concurrent old/new lock protocols
and shared workspaces across hosts, containers, or WSL are not supported.
`dev up` attaches to an existing runtime; `dev restart` explicitly stops it first.
A configured `server.port` (8081 in starters) is the runtime's address: if it is
occupied, startup fails instead of moving to another port. Without a configured
port, Vite may select the next available one. Browser failure does not stop HTTP serving
or HMR, including in foreground mode. `--no-open` disables managed-browser
launches for that session.
Managed browser profiles live in a private OS temporary directory outside the
served workspace. While that directory is retained, localStorage, IndexedDB, and
service workers survive browser recovery; normal OS temporary-file cleanup may
eventually remove them. A browser whose cleanup cannot be confirmed blocks
replacement and reports that condition.

Use `iwsdk runtime status` for the live lifecycle, `runtime targets` for connected
pages and their supported methods, and `runtime wait --input-json
'{"afterRevision":7,"timeoutMs":25000}'` to wait without causing recovery.
`runtime recover` explicitly retries a failed launch. The MCP equivalents are
`runtime_get_status`, `runtime_list_targets`, `runtime_wait`, and `runtime_recover`.
`dev status` remains a read of the persisted discovery snapshot. `dev up`
reports `browserCommandReady` and can return while a lifecycle-managed browser
is still launching; follow its `browserNextAction` or wait until readiness is
true before issuing browser-backed commands.

Commands default to the managed browser. Recovery returns `browser_relaunched`
and `outcome: "not_executed"`; inspect the new state and issue a fresh command.
A disconnection after dispatch returns `outcome_unknown`: a mutation might have
executed, so inspect state before retrying. No command is automatically replayed.

To control a Quest, run `runtime pair-headset --input-json
'{"headsetId":"ADB_SERIAL"}'`, set up `adb -s ADB_SERIAL reverse tcp:PORT tcp:PORT`,
and open the returned URL on that exact device. Pairings last for the dev session.
`runtime targets` returns an exact `runtimeTarget` to copy into tool arguments:

```json
{
  "runtimeTarget": {
    "deviceClass": "physical",
    "headsetId": "ADB_SERIAL",
    "pageId": "page-from-discovery",
    "tabGeneration": 2
  }
}
```

Physical pages are never selected implicitly. Reload runs through the app bridge;
screenshot, snapshot, interaction, profiling, console capture, and the managed
editor remain host-only and return `unsupported_on_target` for physical pages.
Runtime/ECS methods require that page's framework to be ready. Native pose control
still requires the explicit native-XR option. No console listeners are added to
the headset app. A page reload advances its generation; rediscover before another
command. `runtimeTarget` is distinct from existing tools' position-vector `target`.

`browser run` holds the managed command lease for its complete CDP session. Do not
call another managed-browser tool from inside a leased script. A lost runner lease
retires the browser, preventing unfinished CDP work from overlapping later commands.
