# IWSDK Locomotion Example

This is the official locomotion example project for the WebXR Framework, designed for optimal developer, designer, and tech artist workflow.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.19.0+ and pnpm
- HTTPS support for WebXR development

### Installation

```bash
cd locomotion
pnpm install
```

### Development

```bash
# Start development server with HTTPS
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Preview production build locally
pnpm preview
```

The development server will start on the HTTPS local URL reported by Vite or `npx @iwsdk/cli dev status` (typically `https://localhost:5173/` when that port is free).

## 📦 Asset Organization

### WebXR-Optimized Asset Handling

This example uses Vite's `public/` directory for local texture/audio assets and
the shared `@iwsdk/example-assets` catalog for reusable GLTF assets since they
are:

- Loaded at runtime via URLs (not imported as modules)
- Large files that shouldn't be bundled or processed
- Need direct URL access for asset loaders

### Assets Directory Structure

- **Shared stock base** - immutable `@iwsdk/example-assets@0.4.2` CDN delivery,
  overridable with `VITE_IWSDK_EXAMPLE_ASSET_BASE_URL` for a local mirror
- **`public/textures/`** - Images, textures, and visual assets (.png, .jpg, etc.)
- **`public/audio/`** - Sound effects and music files

### Asset Usage

```typescript
const stockAssetBase =
  'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@iwsdk/example-assets@0.4.2/assets';
const assets = defineAssets({
  model: {
    url: `${stockAssetBase}/environment-desk/environmentDesk.gltf`,
    type: AssetType.GLTF,
  },
  texture: {
    url: publicAssetUrl('textures/my-texture.png'),
    type: AssetType.Texture,
  },
});
```

## 🌐 WebXR Development

### HTTPS Requirements

WebXR requires HTTPS for all features to work properly. This example includes:

- Automatic, cached self-signed HTTPS certificates from the IWSDK dev plugin
- No certificate-authority installation or trust-store changes
- Proper CORS configuration for asset loading

### Testing on Devices

```bash
# Find your local IP
ipconfig getifaddr en0  # macOS
# or
hostname -I             # Linux

# Access from VR headset
https://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:<PORT>
```

Accept the headset browser's certificate warning when prompted. The managed
desktop browser accepts the local certificate automatically.

## 🛠 Customization

### Vite Configuration

The `vite.config.js` file includes:

- HTTPS development server setup
- Static asset copying configuration
- Build optimization settings
- Asset handling rules

### Adding New Assets

1. Add reusable GLTF assets to `@iwsdk/example-assets` through its independently
   verified release process, or place one-off assets in the appropriate
   `public/` subdirectory.
2. Pin shared stock assets to an exact CDN version; build local URLs from
   `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` so subpath production builds resolve them.
3. Vite serves and copies only the example's local `public/` assets.

## 📋 Scripts

- **`pnpm dev`** - Start development server with HMR and HTTPS
- **`pnpm build`** - Build for production
- **`pnpm preview`** - Preview production build locally

## 🔗 Integration

This example is designed to work seamlessly with:

- **Native scene JSON** for declarative environment setup
- **WebXR browsers** for VR/AR development
- **Framework tools** for component generation
- **Asset pipelines** for 3D content creation
