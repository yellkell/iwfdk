# UI System Test

Run 5 test suites covering panel loading, ScreenSpace, system registration, component registration, and stability.

**Configuration:**

- EXAMPLE_DIR: `$IWSDK_REPO_ROOT/examples/poke`

**Tool calls**: every tool call is `npx @iwsdk/cli <subcommand> [--input-json '<JSON>'] [--timeout <ms>]`, run from inside the example workspace (cwd `$EXAMPLE_DIR`). The CLI auto-discovers the IWSDK app root from cwd, so no path tricks are required. Run `npx @iwsdk/cli mcp inspect` from the example to discover available tools and their CLI subcommands.

- `<JSON>` is a JSON object string. Omit `--input-json` if no arguments are needed.
- Output is JSON on stdout: `{ok, workspaceRoot, operation, result}`. Parse it to check assertions.
- Use `--timeout 20000` for operations that may take longer (reload, xr enter, screenshot).

**IMPORTANT**: Run each Bash command one at a time. Parse the JSON output and verify assertions before moving to the next command. Do NOT chain multiple CLI commands together.

**IMPORTANT**: When the instructions say "wait N seconds", use `sleep N` as a separate Bash command.

---

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd $IWSDK_REPO_ROOT/examples/poke && npm run fresh:install
```

Wait for this to complete before proceeding.

---

## Step 2: Start Dev Server

Start the dev server as a background task using the Bash tool's `run_in_background: true` parameter:

```bash
cd $IWSDK_REPO_ROOT/examples/poke && npm run dev
```

**IMPORTANT**: This command MUST be run with `run_in_background: true` on the Bash tool — do NOT append `&` to the command itself.

Once the background task is launched, poll the output for Vite's ready message (up to 60s). You can also run `npx @iwsdk/cli dev status` from the example directory until `state.running` becomes `true`. You do not need to extract or manage the port yourself; subsequent commands resolve the active runtime through the CLI automatically.

If the server fails to start within 60 seconds, report FAIL for all suites and skip to Step 5.

---

## Step 3: Verify Connectivity

```bash
npx @iwsdk/cli ecs systems 2>/dev/null
```

This must return JSON with a list of systems. If it fails:

1. Check the dev server output for errors
2. Try killing and restarting the server (Step 2)
3. If it still fails, report FAIL for all suites and skip to Step 5

---

## Step 4: Run Test Suites

### Pre-test Setup

Run these commands in order:

1. `npx @iwsdk/cli browser reload --timeout 20000 2>/dev/null`
   Then: `sleep 3`

2. `npx @iwsdk/cli xr enter --timeout 20000 2>/dev/null`
   Then: `sleep 2`

3. `npx @iwsdk/cli browser logs --input-json '{"count":20,"level":["error","warn"]}' 2>/dev/null`
   Assert: No error-level logs.

---

### Suite 1: Panel Loading

**Test 1.1: Find Panel Entity**

```bash
npx @iwsdk/cli ecs find --input-json '{"withComponents":["ScreenSpace"]}' 2>/dev/null
```

Assert: Exactly 1 entity. Save its `entityIndex` as `<panel>`.

**Test 1.2: Manifest-backed Panel Entity**

```bash
npx @iwsdk/cli ecs query --input-json '{"entityIndex":<panel>,"components":["ScreenSpace","RayInteractable","PokeInteractable"]}' 2>/dev/null
```

Assert:

- `ScreenSpace`, `RayInteractable`, and `PokeInteractable` are present.
- `PanelUI` and `PanelDocument` are absent; the UIKitML document is owned by
  the manifest-backed scene object.

**Test 1.3: PanelUISystem Query Counts**

```bash
npx @iwsdk/cli ecs systems 2>/dev/null
```

Assert:

- `PanelUISystem` is present and has no legacy configured/unconfigured panels.
- `ScreenSpaceUISystem`: `panels: 1`.

---

### Suite 2: ScreenSpace

**Test 2.1: ScreenSpace Values**

```bash
npx @iwsdk/cli ecs query --input-json '{"entityIndex":<panel>,"components":["ScreenSpace"]}' 2>/dev/null
```

Assert:

- `height` = `"50%"` (CSS expression)
- `width` = `"25vw"`
- `top` = `"20px"`
- `left` = `"20px"`
- `bottom` = `"auto"`
- `right` = `"auto"`
- `zOffset` = `0.2` (distance in front of camera near plane)

**Test 2.2: Panel Visible in Screenshot**

```bash
npx @iwsdk/cli browser screenshot --timeout 20000 2>/dev/null
```

Assert: Returns a `screenshotPath` (PNG file saved to /tmp).

**Test 2.3: ScreenSpaceUISystem Active**

```bash
npx @iwsdk/cli ecs systems 2>/dev/null
```

Assert: ScreenSpaceUISystem: `panels: 1`

---

### Suite 3: System Registration

```bash
npx @iwsdk/cli ecs systems 2>/dev/null
```

Assert:

- `PanelUISystem` at priority -3.8, config: kit, componentSets, preferredColorScheme
- `ScreenSpaceUISystem` at priority -3.75
- `FollowSystem` at priority 0

---

### Suite 4: Component Registration

```bash
npx @iwsdk/cli ecs components 2>/dev/null
```

Assert:

- `PanelUI`: config (String) as a legacy raw-URL compatibility component
- `PanelDocument`: document (Object) as legacy runtime state
- `ScreenSpace`: height, width, top, bottom, left, right (all String), zOffset (Float32)

---

### Suite 5: Stability

```bash
npx @iwsdk/cli browser logs --input-json '{"count":30,"level":["error","warn"]}' 2>/dev/null
```

Assert: No application-level errors or warnings. Pre-existing 404 resource errors from page load are acceptable.

---

## Step 5: Cleanup & Results

Kill the dev server:

```bash
cd $IWSDK_REPO_ROOT/examples/poke && npx @iwsdk/cli dev down
```

Output a summary table:

```
| Suite                  | Result    |
|------------------------|-----------|
| 1. Panel Loading       | PASS/FAIL |
| 2. ScreenSpace         | PASS/FAIL |
| 3. System Registration | PASS/FAIL |
| 4. Component Reg.      | PASS/FAIL |
| 5. Stability           | PASS/FAIL |
```

If any suite fails, include which assertion failed and actual vs expected values.

---

## Recovery

If at any point a transient error occurs (server crash, WebSocket timeout, connection refused, etc.) that is NOT caused by a source code bug:

1. Stop the dev server: `cd $IWSDK_REPO_ROOT/examples/poke && npx @iwsdk/cli dev down`
2. Restart: re-run Step 2 to start a fresh dev server
3. Re-run the Pre-test Setup (reload, accept session)
4. Retry the failed suite

Only give up after one retry attempt per suite. If the same suite fails twice, mark it FAIL and continue to the next suite.

---

## Known Issues & Workarounds

### UIKitML asset loading is async

`World.create()` resolves after manifest source preloading, and
`world.assets.instantiate()` resolves after parsing and document creation. The
poke example creates the entity only after that promise resolves.

### ScreenSpace re-parenting in XR

When XR is presenting, `ScreenSpaceUISystem` re-parents the panel from the camera back to the entity's Object3D (world space). CSS positioning only applies outside XR.

### Panel interaction

The panel entity also has `RayInteractable` + `PokeInteractable`, so it participates in ray/touch interaction. The panel's `Hovered` component may be present if the default controller ray is pointing at it.

### Entity indices change on reload

Never cache entity indices across page reloads. Always re-discover via `npx @iwsdk/cli ecs find`.
